There's no shortage of calendars and apps for getting things done. But what about the good old diary? If you remember what it felt like to keep a secret diary, you'll want to know whether this can be done digitally or online. Surprisingly, there aren't quite that many options. Not many companies have ventured into diary applications, for reasons unknown. There are a few websites that cater to this need, but they don't have accompanying apps.
There are diary apps for certain, but some don't have desktop versions - and one needs to be able to write on different devices.
Therefore, we provide you and your family with your very own space to add journal entries and keep them safe and secure. Trust it, it will always keep your secrets with it.
